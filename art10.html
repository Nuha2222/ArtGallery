    <p class="artwork-description">
        Edvard Munch’s The Girl by the Window combines his exposure to Impressionism and Symbolism with his ongoing
        exploration of Romantic themes, such as isolation and inner turmoil. The painting’s mysterious, melancholic
        atmosphere is created through shadowy tones and a symbolic window that separates the girl from the outside
        world, deepening the sense of unease and unspoken tension.
