    <p class="artwork-description">
        Grant Wood’s American Gothic depicts a farmer and his daughter in front of a Carpenter Gothic home, evoking
        images of an earlier generation. While some saw it as a satirical critique of rural life, Wood intended the
        painting to offer a reassuring portrayal of traditional American values during the Great Depression.
