    <p class="artwork-description">
        Around 1920, Georgia O'Keeffe explored translating music into visual art, as seen in Blue and Green Music, where
        colors and forms evoke both nature and sound. Influenced by Vasily Kandinsky’s ideas on art and music, O'Keeffe
        aimed to achieve pure visual expression without literary references.
