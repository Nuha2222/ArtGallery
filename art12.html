        In 1883, Winslow Homer moved to Prouts Neck, Maine, where he painted powerful depictions of fishermen battling
        the sea, a theme that had captivated him since his earlier trips to New England and England. His work, like this
        painting of two fishermen hauling in herring, emphasizes the heroic struggle between humankind and nature,
        highlighting the monumental effort of survival in a vast, unpredictable ocean.
